# Write your general topic.  
topic: Impact of vehicle specifications on CO2 emissions.

# Write your research question, following one of the three allowed templates.
# Be sure your question is all on one line.
RQ: Is there any significant relationship between engine size, fuel type, and transmission type on CO2 emissions in vehicles across different classes?

# Write your independent and dependent variables.  These should be the
# column names (reported by R colnames() where these variables are
# found in your dataset's CSV file.
# Note: if your question is about comparison of means, medians, or
# proportions, the independent variable column is the one that
# contains the values (at least two) that divide the population into
# subsets.
independent-var: Engine.Size.in.Litres, Fuel.Type, Transmission
dependent-var: CO2.Emissions..g.km.

# Write the null hypothesis for your research question, again ensuring it is all on one line.
null-hypothesis: There is no significant relationship between engine size, fuel type, transmission type, and CO2 emissions in vehicles.

# Write the alternative hypothesis for your research question, again ensuring it is all on one line.
alt-hypothesis: There is a significant relationship between engine size, fuel type, transmission type, and CO2 emissions in vehicles.

# Write the dataset ID (KNNN):
dataset-id:

# Write the dataset URL.  
dataset-url: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mhendal/2019-fuel-consumption-ratings-20190514

# Write the dataset CSV filename, exactly as it appears on the Sharepoint list
# (which should be the same as the one in your repository!)
dataset-file: Fuel_Consumption_Ratings.csv

# Paste the output of loading your dataset into R, and executing the
# colnames() function, into the space below the `columns: |` line.
# Put two spaces *before* every line you pasted.

# Loading the dataset
FuelData <- read.csv("Fuel_Consumption_Ratings.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Printing the column names
